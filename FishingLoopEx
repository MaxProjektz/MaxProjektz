<h1 style="text-align: center;">How Did I Do It?</h1>

<h2>Here are some of the main skills I used to create this magical landscape:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>In The Beginning -</b> I started with a blank slate by removing everything from the world outliner. From there, I could add different assets for sky and so on. I then tweaked my sky, atmosphere, clouds, lighting, ect. to capture that magical feel.</li>
  <li><b>Sculpting -</b> I then imported a landscape to start my landscape sculpting process in Unreal Engine</li> 
  <li><b>Landscape Material -</b> I created my own Landscape Auto Master Material that takes the slope and height of my landscape and automatically blends to different textures based on those variables.</li>
  <li><b>Foliage -</b> The foliage tool was used here to add the grass asset, set the lods for better optimization, as well as landscape layering with foliage paint to add a variety of different mushrooms branches, and other odd foliage types. </li>
  <li><b>The Main Attraction -</b> For some type of POI, the giant mushroom was added. Surrounding the mushroom are two magical orbs that hover in circles protecting the ancient mushroom. These orbs were implemented using particle effects</li>
  <li><b>Optimization</b> To wrap it all up, I ran the project and checked my frame rate. I was averaging around 30fps which would not lead to an emmersive experience. I then began to tweak how the light reacts to specific objects such as removing shadows from grass.
  I then began reducing my textures as some of them were way too high. And also set my lods as mentioned when I created my foliage. This led to a much better frame rate and gameplay experience.</li>
</ul>
