<p align"center"><h1>Fishing Game Loop</h1></p>

  In this fishing RPG, the player must aquire the correct bait and find the right fishing spots to catch a variety of fish species.
  Some fish are harder to catch than others and will sell for more money. You can use this money to purchase the keys to new boats,
  aquire minnnow traps to use for better bait, and eventually more as this is still a WIP. If you talk to Vic at the boat shop at the
  start of the game, he may give you the old wooden boat for free if you choose the right dialogue options, if not, you will have to
  fish from the bank until you aquire enough money. The rarest and most expensive fish right now are Northern Pike. If you want to catch
  them, you must trap minnows and use them as bait in deeper waters that can only be reached in a boat. These minnows, however, will come
  off the hook each time a pike bights. You must set the hook at the right time and only reel in the fish if it is tired to avoid snapping
  the line, or losing the fish!

  As stated, this is a "Work In Progress". There are still many things I need to polish such as fish movement, player character, and
  overall quality of gameplay. This however, is a quick showcase of the loop that I have going for the game.
